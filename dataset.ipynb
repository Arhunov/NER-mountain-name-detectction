    "1. **Content Focus**:  \n",
    "   - Include common names of geographical objects such as rivers, lakes, oceans, cities, forests, etc., with an emphasis on mountain names and mountain chains.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Square Bracket Usage**:  \n",
    "   - **Mountain Names**: Always enclose the name of a mountain or mountain chain in square brackets, e.g., [Everest], [Himalayas].  \n",
    "   - **Other Names**: Do NOT enclose names of other objects (e.g., rivers, cities, lakes) in square brackets. This rule is critical and any deviation will be penalized.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Examples**:  \n",
    "   - Correct: \"[Everest] is the highest mountain, Amazon is the biggest river. Amazon River is located in Brazil and [Everest] is located on the border between Nepal and China.\"  \n",
    "   - Incorrect: \"[Amazon River] is located in Brazil and Everest is located on the border between Nepal and China.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Output Guidelines:\n",
    "1. The generated text must not include any phrases like \"Okay, here goes:\" or similar unnecessary additions.  \n",
    "2. Do not write headlines or use emojis in the text.  \n",
    "3. After generating the text, double-check for compliance with the square bracket rules outlined above.  \n",

    "### Text Parameters:\n",
    "- **Text Format**: {rand_format}  \n",
    "- **Text Theme**: {rand_theme}  \n",
    "- **Text Size**: {rand_size}  \n",
    "\n",

The sacred rivers, such as Koshi, flow from the melting glaciers of the [Kaimondake] range, providing life-sustaining water for communities downstream. These communities rely on the local forests for building materials and firewood. The cities of Kathmandu and Namche Bazaar serve as important hubs for the people living in the surrounding mountainous regions. Many Sherpas work as guides, helping climbers ascend the towering peaks of the [Sakurajima] and [Broad Peak].\\n',\n",

The air was thin, but the views were breathtaking, with snow-capped peaks piercing the azure sky. I continued my trek, soon crossing the mighty Amazon river, feeling its power rushing beneath my feet. The next day, I reached the city of Quito, nestled high in the mountains, before heading towards the dense [Nasu]. I was excited to finally climb [Mount Kilimanjaro] after months of preparation, imagining the breathtaking panorama from its summit. Later, my route took me past Lake Baikal, where the clear, deep water reflected the sky. The vast [Wellington] loomed on the horizon, promising a challenging but rewarding climb in the days to come. The memory of the journey down the Ganges river also came to my mind as I reached the camp before starting the last climb toward the top of [Nasu]. I also remembered the amazing sunsets I saw from the [Kaimondake] during my last trip.\\n',\n",
